# Arduino optical shutters for free space optical experiments

This is an Arduino project dedicated to automate three home made optical shutters (light caches mounted on a DC motor) used in free space optical experiments. The Arduino board is controlled by a python driver script running on a computer, through a serial (USB) connection.
